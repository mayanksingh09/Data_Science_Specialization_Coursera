The shiny app is a simple regression model predicting Horsepower using the MPG values.
There are namely two models used on the app:

1. Simple linear model (HP v/s MPG) - Model 1
2. Cubic polynomial model (HP v/s MPG) - Model 2

Steps to use the app:
- To use the app simply use the slider to choose an MPG value you want to predict the HP for and click on the Submit button.
- The check boxes will show and display the two curves for the respective models.
- Make sure you click on Submit after changing the slider values to update the predictions.
